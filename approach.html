  <h3> One-on-one Private Tutoring</h3>
  <p>The session is 100% dedicated to you and your learning. You have the tutor's undivided attention and instruction for the whole hour so that they may best serve your individual educational needs. We believe that this offers the best support to the group environment of classroom education.</p>

    <h3> 100% Customized Learning Plans</h3>
  <p>After our first (free!) consultation session, we develop an individualized learning plan based on your goals and timeline, and make ongoing adjustments whenever needed. We aim to be completely flexible toward your educational needs.</p>

  <h3> Strong Student-Tutor Relationships</h3>
  <p>All of our tutors are highly qualified and passionate about teaching. After our initial consultation, we work to match you with a tutor that we believe fits you best and will provide a strong ongoing relationship.</p>


  <h3> (Guided) Practice Makes Perfect</h3>
  <p>Rote memorization techniques are now largely a relic of the past, with greater emphasis on the 'big picture' ideas. Still, we believe the best way to learn how to do something... is to do it! Our sessions emphasize getting you to do the work yourself and intervening to help when you get stuck. We don't want to just show you what to do next though! We help students think and reason about problems with the aim of getting them to figure it out themselves as much as possible.</p>


  <h3> Solid Foundations</h3>
  <p>Many students struggle with new material because there are knowledge gaps or insufficient basic skills from lower levels. We work continually to identify these weak points and remedy them so that students can focus more easily on new concepts.</p>

  <h3>Confidence Is Key</h3>
  <p>Students that feel overwhelmed can't learn and often can't apply what they already do know. We emphasize a patient, low stress learning environment and want to make our sessions enjoyable for our students, so that they may work hard and achieve their highest potential. We show students how capable they really are and celebrate their progress and work ethic.</p>

  <h3> Always Looking Ahead</h3>
  <p>We aren't just interested in helping you pass that Trigonometry test... We want to make sure you have the skills not only to succeed in your present courses, but in your future ones as well! We push our students beyond their grade level whenever appropriate to best prepare them for future academic success.</p>

  <h3> Beyond The Session</h3>
  <p>We're here to provide mentorship and help plan for the future. We're always happy to offer advice on Course planning, University admissions, test prep, scholarship/bursary applications, student loans, and more! We want to see our students succeed in all their future endeavours and will help you navigate these kinds of things wherever we can. </p>
