<h1>Our Mission</h1>
<div style="margin-left: 10px ">
<p >At iterum, we strive to empower our students to realize their fullest academic potential by providing a friendly, comfortable, low stress environment in which we help walk them through their journey of education. We focus on building confidence through solidifying and remediating basic skills and developing learning strategies and study skills that are most effective to the individual's personal learning needs. We believe education should be equitable and accessible for all. </p>

<p>We would like to acknowledge that at iterum we live and work on the unceded traditional territories of the Coast Salish peoples of the Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh Nations. </p> 
</div>
<h1> iterum (it′ər·əm)</h1>
<p style="margin-left: 10px ">The word iterum (it′ər·əm) is latin and roughly translates to 'again' or 'once more'. It is a basic tenet of our approach to education that clear comprehension and understanding of a concept is only the first step to mastery of that concept. Repeated exposure and application across many contexts is required not only to reinforce but also to relate and integrate new knowledge.   </p>

    <div class="flex-item-big"><h3>Jake - BSc. Mathematics</h3>
    <p> I possess a B. Sci. degree in Mathematics from Simon Fraser University, with extensive additional coursework in Computing Science and Philosophy. I am originally from the United Kingdom and immigrated to Canada with my family when I was 14 years old,  attending high school here in BC where I repeatedly won the CEMC Mathematics competition’s ‘School Champion’ award.</p><p>

     Before entering my undergraduate studies, I took a year off and worked with youth facing employment barriers through Pathfinders Youth Centre Society and also volunteered at Cythera Transitions House Thrift Store in Maple Ridge.</p><p>

    My interest in tutoring began during my degree when several friends in humanities programs requested my assistance in helping them with their Math and Computing courses. I found I was empathetic to different learning styles and was able to break down difficult abstract concepts into more easily relatable and digestible components. </p><p>

  I support approaching problems in the way that each student personally finds most intuitive and gradually building upon their weaknesses while also appropriately challenging their strengths. I am a strong believer in the triumph of consistency, effort, and positive enthusiasm over that of ‘natural talent’, and always aim to encourage my students to achieve their highest capabilities. I am also an advocate for making education more accessible and respectful for all, and balancing the challenges and growth of learning with the need for patience and mental wellness.</p>

    <div class="flex-item-big"><h3>Danaan - BSc. Chemical Physics (Honours)</h3>
    <p>
I was born and raised in East Vancouver and hold an undergraduate honours degree in Chemical Physics from Simon Fraser University. Throughout my undergrad, I was highly involved in scientific research, receiving an Undergraduate Student Research Award (USRA) from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) to participate in experiments at TRIUMF, the particle accelerator at UBC. For this work, I received the Chemistry Undergraduate Research Presentation Award and the Melanie O’Neill Undergraduate Research Award. I also presented at the 9th Pacific Symposium on Radical Chemistry in California and won a poster prize. In the summer of 2020, I received the Rudi Haering Award in Physics, and I was selected as Student Speaker to represent the Faculty of Science during my virtual convocation ceremony. </p><p>
I also have 6 years of experience working at Sasamat Outdoor Centre, a summer camp and outdoor education center located in Belcarra, BC, where I have coordinated day camp programs for children, facilitated a leadership program for teens, and delivered nature-based lessons to participants of all ages. I am passionate about teaching, and I aim to make my lessons as engaging as possible while offering support and encouragement to my students. </p>
